# CustomerChurn-DataAnalysis
Analyst: Ngoc To

### Background: 
- The competition among commercial banks to retain customers is increasingly intense, requiring specific strategies to prevent customer attrition. Data science, supported by machine learning and AI, plays a critical role in predicting customer behavior and identifying early signs of risk.
- Machine learning not only aids in risk prediction but also helps identify potential customers and develop effective retention strategies. Applying data science enables banks to optimize costs, enhance business strategies, and improve customer experience, fostering sustainable development.
- The project employs machine learning models such as **k-NN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest,** and **Neural Network** to analyze customer attrition trends and propose effective customer management strategies.
### About Dataset
- This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.
